 - The rsync in the Vagrant file does not work. Soumik is looking after it. 
 - We need to design the DSpace and sync the updates manually. 
	
 - We are getting the following error msg again: `Required metadata field 'dc.title' doesn't exist!`
 - We got new dump of the postgres db `dspace.pgsql`
 - We imported the db using `psql -U dspace dspace < dspace.pgsql` command
